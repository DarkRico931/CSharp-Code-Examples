# Guidelines
This shows the guidelines which should be followed when adding to this repository.

1. Use the namespace `CSharp_Code_Examples`
2. Each class should have a `public static` method called `run()`.
3. The method should be preceded by two single line comments:  
   One which says `//Authors: ` which should be completed with your name  
   One which describes very briefly what the code does:  
   eg: `//Reads all of the text from a textfile into a string`
4. The `Program.cs` file should be able to run the code example directly, eg: `HelloLincoln.run();`
